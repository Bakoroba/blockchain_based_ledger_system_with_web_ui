# Blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface

## Objective
Build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Tasks
1. Step 1: Create a Record Data Class
Create a new data class named `Record`.
- This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger

3. Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
- Change the existing `Block` data class by replacing the generic `data` attribute with a `record` attribute that’s of type `Record`.

3. Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
- Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that you’ll store in the `PyChain` ledger.

4. Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
- Test your complete `PyChain` ledger.

5. Test results
